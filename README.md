# SwerveDriveKinematics
temporary repository for swerve drive

this repository will be used for swerve drive kinematics and actual drivetrain as I attempt to achieve a working four swerve module chassis.
the repository is temporary because I'm planning on moving the code to another new repository in the github organization of NeatTeam #1943.
